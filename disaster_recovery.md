## üìã INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### P0: MAINNET DOWN

**Symptoms:**
- No new blocks for >5 minutes
- All nodes unreachable
- Database corruption
- Consensus failure

**Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes):**

```bash
# 1. Verify the issue
./scripts/health-check.sh

# 2. Check if it's a network partition
./scripts/check-network-partition.sh

# 3. Review recent changes
git log --since="1 hour ago"

# 4. Check system resources
./scripts/check-resources.sh

# 5. Review logs for errors
./scripts/tail-critical-logs.sh
```

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Assess Scope:**
   ```bash
   # How many nodes affected?
   kubectl get pods -n dinari-production
   
   # Check database health
   ./scripts/db-health-check.sh
   
   # Check for consensus issues
   ./scripts/consensus-status.sh
   ```

2. **Initiate Rollback (if recent deployment):**
   ```bash
   # Rollback to last known good version
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/dinari-node -n dinari-production
   kubectl rollout status deployment/dinari-node -n dinari-production
   ```

3. **Database Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Stop all nodes
   kubectl scale deployment/dinari-node --replicas=0 -n dinari-production
   
   # Restore from latest checkpoint
   ./scripts/restore-from-checkpoint.sh
   
   # Verify database integrity
   ./scripts/verify-db-integrity.sh
   
   # Restart nodes
   kubectl scale deployment/dinari-node --replicas=5 -n dinari-production
   ```

4. **Monitor Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Watch block production
   watch -n 5 './scripts/get-latest-block.sh'
   
   # Monitor peer connections
   watch -n 5 'kubectl exec dinari-node-0 -- curl -s localhost:8545/peers | jq .peer_count'
   ```

### P0: SECURITY BREACH

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access detected
- Abnormal transaction patterns
- Private key exposure suspected
- DDoS attack in progress

**Immediate Actions:**

```bash
# 1. ISOLATE THE THREAT
# Block all external connections
./scripts/emergency-firewall-lockdown.sh

# 2. ACTIVATE CIRCUIT BREAKER
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545/admin/circuit-breaker/open

# 3. CAPTURE FORENSICS
./scripts/capture-forensics.sh /var/forensics/$(date +%s)

# 4. NOTIFY SECURITY TEAM
./scripts/send-security-alert.sh "P0 Security Incident"
```

**Forensics & Analysis:**

```bash
# Check for unauthorized access
./scripts/audit-access-logs.sh --since="1 hour"

# Review transaction anomalies
./scripts/detect-anomalous-transactions.sh

# Check for compromised keys
./scripts/scan-for-compromised-keys.sh

# Network traffic analysis
./scripts/analyze-network-traffic.sh
```

**Containment:**

```bash
# Rotate all keys
./scripts/emergency-key-rotation.sh

# Blacklist suspicious IPs
./scripts/blacklist-ips.sh /tmp/suspicious-ips.txt

# Enable enhanced monitoring
./scripts/enable-enhanced-monitoring.sh

```

---

### P0: DATA CORRUPTION

**Symptoms:**
- State root mismatch
- Block validation failures
- Database consistency errors

**Recovery Procedure:**

```bash
# 1. STOP ALL NODES IMMEDIATELY
kubectl scale deployment/dinari-node --replicas=0 -n dinari-production

# 2. IDENTIFY CORRUPTION POINT
./scripts/find-corruption-point.sh

# 3. RESTORE FROM CHECKPOINT
# Find last good checkpoint
./scripts/list-checkpoints.sh | tail -5

# Restore from specific checkpoint
./scripts/restore-checkpoint.sh checkpoint_1234567890

# 4. VERIFY RESTORATION
./scripts/verify-chain-integrity.sh

# 5. RESTART NODES
kubectl scale deployment/dinari-node --replicas=5 -n dinari-production

# 6. FORCE RESYNC IF NEEDED
./scripts/force-resync-all-nodes.sh
```
